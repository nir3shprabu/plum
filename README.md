This repository contains the source code behind the plugin marketplace that will be running at [marketplace.pretix.eu](https://marketplace.pretix.eu), providing a way to find both open source and commercial plugins to pretix. While being designed for the requirements of pretix, plum is not specific to pretix and can be used by other platforms as well.

Right now, it is nowhere complete or even functional.
